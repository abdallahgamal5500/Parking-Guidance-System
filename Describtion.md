This project is about a Parking Guidance System. This project has 3 modules.
Firstly, there is the Customer module. This module allows the customer to do simple tasks to print out the
ticket used in the parking station. This ticket contains certain details. Such as, entry ID, plate number and
the date o entering the parking station. The module is also responsible for accepting the payment for the
parking service per every ticket. This is done by calculating the parking hours for every ticket respective
to their ID.
Secondly, there is the Operator module. This module is split into 2 parts, Entry station, and Exit Station.
In the Entry Station, the operator is allowed to access and monitor the available parking lots in the station.
This is mandatory to know how many empty lots in the station to allow cars to enter. This will help the
operator recommend parking locations for the entering cars. In the Exit Station, the operator will take the
ticket and will calculate the payment fees. This is done by entering the ticket ID and calculating the total
parking hours for the respective car.
Finally, there is the admin module. The admin, owner of the place, has the ability to add new lots to the
parking station in case of expansion. The admin also has the privilege to view the total parking spots
vacant and busy ones, in the station. Being able to add, delete, and update different usersâ€™ details and
accounts is a must for the admin. The admin also manages their employees by getting reports on the
employees shifts and they payroll.
